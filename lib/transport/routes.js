// A service and the locations it calls at.
//
// `serves` is a set of location slugs, not an ordered list: it answers "can I
// get from here to there on one service", which is the question a section
// actually asks. Direction and journey time would need ordering and a great
// deal more maintenance.
//
// `season` sits on the route rather than the provider — an operator can run
// year-round while one particular service is summer-only, which is exactly the
// case here.
//
// A caution learned the hard way: bus service pages move. The bustimes.org URL
// for this service, captured from a search result, already redirects to the
// operator's page because the service slug changed. Treat `url` as a fact with
// a date on it, like anything else carrying `verified`.
